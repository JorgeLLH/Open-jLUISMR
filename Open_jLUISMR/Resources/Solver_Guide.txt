This is a short description of the solvers currently available in Open jLUISMR, based on the documentation available for "DifferentialEquations.jl" (for more info visit: https://diffeq.sciml.ai/stable/).

	-Tsit5(): The default solver and recommended for most cases. It is an explicit Runge-Kutta method, consider a different solver if you are solving stiff equations.
	-AutoTsit5(Rosenbrock23()): Recommended solver when the stiffness of the problem is unknown. 
	-ImplicitEuler: 1st order solver for stiff equations. (A-B-L-stable; adaptive timestepping; strong-stability preserving). 
	-TRBDF2: 2nd order solver for stiff equations (A-B-L-S-stable; one-step method; error estimates for adaptive timestepping; smoothed derivatives).
	-ROS3P: 3rd order solver for stiff equations (A-stable; stiffly stable Rosenbrok method; high accuracy on discrtization of nonlinear-parabolic-PDEs).
